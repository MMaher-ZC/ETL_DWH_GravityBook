# Gravity Books ETL Project

## Project Overview
The **Gravity Books ETL Project** leverages **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)** to implement a comprehensive **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline. The project focuses on efficiently managing the data flow from multiple sources into a centralized **SQL Server database**, streamlining the process for analyzing book inventory, sales, and customer transactions. Additionally, **Power BI** is used to build interactive dashboards for visualizing key business metrics, providing insights into sales trends, inventory levels, and customer behavior.

## Features

### 1. Data Extraction
- **Sources**:
  - **Databases**: Extract data from relational databases (e.g., book inventory, sales records, and customer transactions).
  - **Flat Files**: Pull data from external files (e.g., CSV, Excel) containing supplementary or legacy data.
- **Automation**: The extraction process is automated using SSIS to pull data on a scheduled basis.

### 2. Data Transformation
- **Validation**: Ensures the integrity of the incoming data by applying validation rules (e.g., verifying data types, checking for null or missing values).
- **Cleansing**: Cleans data to remove duplicates, correct errors, and standardize values across the dataset.
- **Business Logic**: Implements business-specific rules, such as calculating discounts, categorizing books, or generating sales summaries.

### 3. Data Loading
- **SQL Server Database**: The transformed data is loaded into a centralized SQL Server database, optimized for query performance and analytics.
- **Table Structures**: The data is organized into relational tables for efficient storage and retrieval, supporting a wide range of analytical queries.

### 4. Power BI Dashboarding
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Power BI is used to build dynamic, real-time dashboards that visualize the data from the SQL Server database.
- **Key Visualizations**:
  - **Sales Performance**: Displays metrics such as total sales, sales by category, top-selling books, and revenue trends.
  - **Inventory Levels**: Provides an overview of stock levels, reorder points, and inventory turnover rates.
  - **Customer Behavior**: Analyzes customer purchase patterns, preferences, and loyalty metrics (e.g., repeat purchases, average spend per customer).
- **Custom Filters**: Users can filter data by time periods, book categories, customer segments, and other dimensions for detailed analysis.
- **Drill-Down Features**: Allows users to explore detailed insights by clicking on high-level metrics to reveal underlying data (e.g., drilling down from total sales to individual customer purchases).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories to facilitate maintenance and collaboration:

- **Backups**: Contains backup files for the project to ensure data security and restore points.
- **Diagrams**: Includes database schema diagrams and ETL process flowcharts that outline the system architecture.
- **Gravity Books**: The core directory containing the main ETL files, including SSIS packages and configurations.
- **Outputs**: Stores the output data generated by the ETL process, such as final datasets or intermediate results used in reporting.
- **Packages Screens**: Contains screenshots of the SSIS packages for documentation and visualization of the ETL flow.
- **SQL Queries**: Includes all the SQL scripts used for data management, including data manipulation, queries, and maintenance tasks.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Contains Power BI files for the interactive dashboards created in the project.

## Technologies Used
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)**: Handles the ETL process for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **SQL Server**: Acts as the destination database for centralized data storage and analytics.
- **Power BI**: Used for building interactive dashboards that visualize sales, inventory, and customer metrics.
- **SQL**: Used for querying the database, managing tables, and automating tasks like data validation and cleansing.

## Use Cases
- **Inventory Management**: Track book stock levels, reorder points, and supplier information.
- **Sales Analysis**: Generate reports on sales performance, identify bestsellers, and analyze revenue trends.
- **Customer Insights**: Analyze customer purchasing behavior, preferences, and transaction history for targeted marketing.
- **Business Reporting**: Provide real-time insights through Power BI dashboards for decision-makers to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).

The **Gravity Books ETL Project** provides a robust and scalable solution for managing book inventory, sales, and customer data. By integrating Power BI, the project ensures that stakeholders have access to real-time, actionable insights for effective decision-making.
